A Helm Chart is a packaged Kubernetes deployment.  Datadog (the company) has created a Helm chart that correctly deploys the agent.  

The Datadog Helm chart is completely seperate from the application that the customer is building.  They may at some point put their application in a Helm chart, but it should be considered just a package manager for Kubernetes like apt, yum and homebrew are package managers for OS's.
